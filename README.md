# Subject: Face and gender recognition

Introduction: When scouting for a subject for this final deep learning assignment, different subjects and types of analysis was considered. We knew that we wanted to work with image recognition in some sort of way, because we find the technology rather interesting and useful for a vast amount of use cases. Face recognition can be applied to different business or personal objectives, and can help solve problems regarding identity authentication, healthcare or surveillance and security matters, to name a few. Through the lectures of the course, different image recognition techniques and types of codes has been presented, giving us the needed tools for an analytic task like we will present in this rapport where the objective is to classify the gender of people by letting the neural network look and learn from a dataset of images and attributes. We hope that you as the reader will enjoy our work. And now, let the fun begin! 

Data Collected: This dataset consist of more than 200.000 face images of various celebrities, with more than 10.000 unique identities and 40 attributes per image, names and gender is not included. This dataset is great for training and testing models for face detection, particularly for recognising facial attributes such as finding people with brown hear, are smiling, or wearing glasses. Images cover large pose variations, background clutter, diverse people, supported by a large quantity of images and rich annotations. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.com.
